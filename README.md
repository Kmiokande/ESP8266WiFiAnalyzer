# ESP8266 WiFi Analyzer

The ESP8266 WiFi Analyzer project can be found originally [here](https://github.com/moononournation/ESP8266WiFiAnalyzer). However, for organizational purposes, I ended up creating my own repository containing the best worked schematics.

## Hardware

This project requires the following hardware in order to work:

* Any ESP8266 Board
* 2.4" TFT Touch Screen w/ ili9341
* Jumper Wires
* Breadboard
